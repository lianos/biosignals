Package: biosignals
Title: Smoothing and peak/edge finding in 1D data (signal vectors).
Description: Do many things you want to do to "signal vectors."
  The part of the code in this package to find edges in a 1d signal is adapted
  from the MATLAB edge_detector_1d written by the CISMM group at UNC
  (see URLs for references).
